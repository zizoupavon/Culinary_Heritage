I miss eating the cultural and ethnic foods my grandmother or mom used to cook for me as a kid. Since i've moved out of home for a job and to start my own family I have had this void which i haven't been able to fill. I really enjoy cooking food too and often catch myself calling my mom or my dad asking about which ingredients i should buy or how should i cook it and the order of events of when to add what to make the dish taste, look and smell as my mom, grandma or dad's did.
My family is from the Konkan region of India and we have a very particular type of culinary style , heavy on coconut and rice and fish. There is very little documented and to refer to, i know there is a book called Rasachandrika and i have a PDF version of it. It would be nice to have a ChatGPT like interface where i could just ask a question about my mood and it would recommend a Konkani dish for me, tell me what to buy, and how to cook it. And also allow me to ask it about particular dish and it will tell me al about it.
I also used to visit my maternal grandparents during the summer break and they were ISKON devotees, they also had a very peculiar culinary style, strictly vegetarian, non onion, no garlic, no tea, no coffee. Sometimes referred to as Satvik food. My grandmother used to make some amazing food which was simple and comforting. It would be nice to have access to this whenever i need.
This is a deeply personal and culturally rich project. We aren't just building a "recipe bot"; we are creating a Digital Culinary Heirloom
